<h1>journal entries:</h1> 

<h2> entry three </h2>

<p> 8.10.22 - last week i worked a lot on my website, specifically the homepage where you can go to my projects or journal. i'm trying to make my original idea more aesthetically pleasing and also make a heading for the little banner greeting, but i kind of forget how to do all the fonts and stuff (i'll go check on the classes thing when i finish writing this). i also plan on coding some really simple little pages for the surprises if you click on the wrong box. 

<h2> entry two </h2>

<p> 8.2.22 - hi again! this week, i actually started making my website, which is really cool. i'm trying to make it so that you have to drag the cursor across the screen to reveal where the links are to my projects and journal, but right now there's a weird problem with the spacing that i'll ask molly about next class. i really like this project so far, and i feel like i'm actually coding something real, which is kind of crazy. i'm still learning all the new tags and things to make everything work, but i feel like i'm getting the hang of it. 

<h2> entry one </h2>

<p> this week, i learned about the word meta. i had heard the term before that and i had watched the matrix, but i didn't really know what it meant. on that topic, i learned that it's possible to access things on your computer like folders and things through the terminal, and the desktop isn't even a real thing. i also learned today that there are multiple (!!!) places to get boba in this neighborhood.
