<h1>journal entries:</h1>

<h2> entry thirteen (final entry!!)</h2>

<p>5.30.23 - this is the last journal entry of the year! i am super proud of all the things i've made this year, and i'm really looking forward to my comp sci class next year. my favorite project all year was probably the rainbow, even though it's pretty simple. i'm really happy that i was able to learn enough code to come up with an idea and create it from scratch, and i hope that i'll be able to remember enough of what i've learned to build on it later.</p>

<h2> entry twelve</h2> 

<p>4.21.23 - i added two projects: the circles project and my personal presentation that i made with reveal.js. i did both of these while babysitting four kids at once, which i think is pretty impressive. for the circles project, since i missed the class when we learned how to do it, i had to use some code that molly sent me. it was a little challenging to figure it by inspecting someone else's page, but i figured out how to do it and was even able to randomize the color and get a bunch of different pink shades, which i was proud of. i wish that i had been able to randomize the size, but i wasn't able to figure out how to make the height and width the same when using a random value (because otherwise it would make an oval.) after i finished that, i decided to make my presentation about my music taste because that was honestly the first thing i thought of. it definitely looks unfinished, and i tried to clean it up a little bit, but i was super confused by the reveal.js website and couldn't find the code to change what i wanted. maybe i will make a lab to fix that. bye!</p>

<h2> entry eleven </h2>

<p> 3.10.23 - i finished my rock paper scissors project, and i'm super super proud of it because i did it almost all by myself, and it feels like i actually know how to make something on my own now. i was able to use a lot of things i already knew, like how the inner text takes up space, to fix my own errors without outside help. also, i made the scoreboard completely solo and figured out how to code the variables and debug them without asking anyone. i looked at another project online that was already completed to get an idea of how to fix it after i identified the problem myself. before i fixed it, the variable had been resetting every time, so the scores could never increase above one. after looking at caden's code on the team website, i was able to fix that by adding in a secion that increased my variable by one outside of the innertext. </p>

<h2> entry ten </h2>

<p> 2.23.23 - buggy code:<br>first, in the style section, there is a div called "buggy" that is given a height, width, background, etc. <br> then, in the body, "buggy" is created. in javascript, the buggy's position is set. a variable "x" is created that moves the div to the left. then, an event listener makes it so that the page registers when a key is pressed. when a key is pressed, the "x" incrases by ten. finally, the buggy's position moves left by "x" pixels.</p>

<h2> entry nine </h2>

<p> 2.13.23 - i've been working on making a valentine for the past couple weeks, and i decided to dedicate it to my parents. i spent a while picking out individual images for each letter, but i'm really proud of how it looks once i figured out how to position all of them. during this project, i learned how to change the opacity in the style and javascript sections, and how to use a class to change all of them in the same way. i also got more practice using and setting up event listeners because i used the "click" function to create the button that opens the valentine. when the button is clicked, it makes all the letters that spell out "happy valentine's day" disappear, and it makes some text over a pink div visible that has a message for my parents. 

<h2> entry eight </h2>

<p> 1.18.23 - i edited my index page to look more interesting and used a lab made it colorful. i also added the study guide i made for some of the html terms, and anther one in the form of an array to help me prepare for my pride and prejudice quiz tomorrow. in class, we've been talking about color and how that works in javascript and css, so i made two projects related to that. the first one, i did in class, and it changes the red and blue vales to correspond with the mouse's position on the screen. then, for homework, i made a page with six divs that are each a different color of the rainbow. when the user's mouse goes over each div, it changes color. i was really proud of this because i was able to reference some old work i had done to create this page without any outside help.</p>

<h2> entry seven </h2>

<p> 12.9.22 - i made an array, which outputs a random variable when you click on it. i used this to make an automatic meal planner that can tell you a salad, pasta, cookie, and drink. i haven't really stylized it, but i like how simplistic it is compared to some of my other pages. 

<h2> entry six </h2>

<p> 12.1.22 - i made a squarequilt with lots of pictures that i took of nyc when it was really pretty. i had a lot of work tonight and got home late, so i didn't finish it, but i intend to go back and work on it more over the weekend/when i have time. the code i used has ("+ x +".jpg) to "count" using the code, which allowed me to basically copy my instructions for each image 15 times, instead of doing it all individually. i also used the alert function to make a little message at the beginning that explains what the project is. i tried to make all the images fit in little squares, but the contain function wasn't really working (i also tried a bunch of other alternatives), so i just kept them in rectangular shapes, which i think i actually like more. 

<h2> entry five </h2>

<p> 11.18.22 - i made my gift, which is kind of terrifying, but i also think it's hilarious. i made a lab with molly to work out the code for making it work, and i also copied from what i had done in class. it was kind of hard figuring out how to put in the music links and making it rotate between the songs/images, but i figured it out eventually. the card was originally going to be for mira, but i think it's not going to have a dedication now and it's mostly to make people laugh/have a little relaxing page.</p>

<h2> entry four </h2>

<p> 10.16.22 - i made this animation because i wanted to try changing the colors instead of the border radius like we saw in class. i think that this code works by telling the "frames" to progress in a certain order that has benchmarks to tell it what it should look like during that part of the transition. (for example, the percentages tell the code what it should look like in between each of those parts, and it fills in the blanks like other animations.)

<h2> entry three </h2>

<p> 10.8.22 - last week i worked a lot on my website, specifically the homepage where you can go to my projects or journal. i'm trying to make my original idea more aesthetically pleasing and also make a heading for the little banner greeting, but i kind of forget how to do all the fonts and stuff (i'll go check on the classes thing when i finish writing this). i also plan on coding some really simple little pages for the surprises if you click on the wrong box. 

<h2> entry two </h2>

<p> 10.2.22 - hi again! this week, i actually started making my website, which is really cool. i'm trying to make it so that you have to drag the cursor across the screen to reveal where the links are to my projects and journal, but right now there's a weird problem with the spacing that i'll ask molly about next class. i really like this project so far, and i feel like i'm actually coding something real, which is kind of crazy. i'm still learning all the new tags and things to make everything work, but i feel like i'm getting the hang of it. 

<h2> entry one </h2>

<p> this week, i learned about the word meta. i had heard the term before that and i had watched the matrix, but i didn't really know what it meant. on that topic, i learned that it's possible to access things on your computer like folders and things through the terminal, and the desktop isn't even a real thing. i also learned today that there are multiple (!!!) places to get boba in this neighborhood.
