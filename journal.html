<p> this week, i learned about the word meta. i had heard the term before that and i had watched the matrix, but i didn't really know what it meant. on that topic, i learned that it's possible to access things on your computer like folders and things through the terminal, and the desktop isn't even a real thing. i also learned today that there are multiple (!!!) places to get boba in this neighborhood.
